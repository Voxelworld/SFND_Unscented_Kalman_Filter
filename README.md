Sensor Fusion UKF Highway Project

In this project you will implement an Unscented Kalman Filter to estimate the state of multiple cars on a highway using noisy lidar and radar measurements. 

For further details see original [README.md](https://github.com/udacity/SFND_Unscented_Kalman_Filter/blob/master/README.md).
